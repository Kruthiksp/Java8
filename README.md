# Java8
Solving one Java8 questions daily starting from very basic to advance covering all the features.

<h2>Daily Problem Statements</h2>
<pre>
01. Given a list of integers, use Java 8 Stream API to filter out the even numbers and collect them into a new list.
02. Given a list of integers, use Java 8 Stream API and map() to square each number and collect the results into a new list.
03. Given a list of integers,
    Filter only the odd numbers
    Square each of those odd numbers
    Collect the result into a new list.
04. Given a list of lowercase strings, use Java 8 Stream and map() to convert each string to uppercase and collect the result into a new list.
05. Given a list of strings, sort them in ascending order of their lengths using Java 8 features.
06. Given a list of Person Object,
    Sort the list of Person objects by age in ascending order
    Then by name in alphabetical order if ages are equal.
07. Given a list of Product Object,
    Filter the products that cost more than â‚¹1000
    Collect the result into a new List
    Print the filtered list.
08. Given a list of Product Object,
    Convert this list into a Map<String, Double> where
        -> Key = Product name
        -> Value = Product price
    If the product names are duplicated
        -> Use  "Merge Function".
09. Given a Map<String, Integer> representing products and their stock quantities
    Filter products where the stock is less than 100.
    Sort the result by stock quantity (ascending).
    Collect into a new LinkedHashMap (to maintain sort order).
    Print the result.
10 Given a list of Transaction objects
	Group the transactions by category
	Find the total amount spent in each category
	Store the result in a Map<String, Double>
	Print the final grouped totals
